# Yu-Lun Hsu's Portfolio
## Overview
This porfolio belongs to Yu-Lun Hsu. The repository includes:

 * 01 Machine_Learning

 * 02 Virtual_Effects

 * 03 System_Programming

 * 04 Interdisciplinary_Research
 * 05 Computer_Architecture

The codes in these projects are mainly written in C and Python. Verilog, shell are also used for specific needs.



## 01 Machine_Learning
My team attended one mango-grade-classification completion in AIDEA. We also published our result on IEEE ICMLA 2020. Our paper - Deep Learning for Automatic Quality Grading of Mangoes: Methods and Insights, was accepted as a full conference paper and possibly published by Springer.

## 02 Virtual_Effects
I have implemented two kinds of image processing: HDR and image stitching. Also, two classmates and I made a video with visual effects including image morphing, camera tracking, 3D model.
## 03 System_Programming
There are three projects in this topic. Pipe, fifo, signals, multiplexing and more are implemented to fullfill the auction system, mask pre-order system and pseudothread system.
## 04 Interdisciplinary_Research
I used the knowledge I learned in two departments to do some interdisciplinary research. One is image processing, and the other is deep learning for discovery of antibiotics. Some experiments are conducted by myself in the former research.
## 05 Computer_Architecture
I have constructed the single cycle CPU supporting RV64I. The CPU reads 32-bit instructions and operates on 64-bit registers and data memory.
