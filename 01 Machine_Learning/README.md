## Automatic mango grading
This project was done with Tung and Wu. We use several deep learning-based methods to approach the mango grading problems.

The architecture of our model implementation base on VGG backbone with small variations. Please note that we use parametric ReLU(PReLU) instead of ReLU as the activation function.
