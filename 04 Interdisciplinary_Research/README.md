# Interdisciplinary research
Combining two fields that I love has always been my dream. I hope one day I could use knowledge learned from medicine and computer science to solve problems.

In my opinion, Machine learning and image processing could benefit medicine. Hence, I have done some research about two topics.
## Application of Artificial intelligence in medicine
In this report, we discuss the application of artificial intelligence to discover the new antibiotic - Halicin. The development of new approaches that can substantially decrease the cost and increase the rate of antibiotic discovery is essential. We could expect more potential drugs to be discovered.
## Image processing
I used knowledge in VFX to decompose the MRI images into low-frequency images and high-frequency images. The sharper and clearer images are obtained from boosting high-frequency images. This could help the doctor to well recognize the organs.
